# Installation
1) Pull the project.
2) Run 'npm install' in both /client and /server directories

# Testing
Best practice for dev is to use two terminals:
1) In the first terminal run 'npm run server' // this will run the node.js server
2) In the second terminal run 'npm run client' // this will run the react client

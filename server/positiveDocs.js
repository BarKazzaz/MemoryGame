    `good morning and welcome live.`,

    `you might.`,

    `at some point. i'm not forecast maybe it recovers.heard some comments from couple minutes ago about you know when stocks are cheap that's whenlike to buy. when they're cheaper than they were the day before. maybe he can assuage market participates fear at this point. let's look at the treasury yields. looking at the tenyear which you would expect bonds to be strong this morning and you do see the yield at some of the lowest levels on the tenyear that we've seen inwhile. down below . ..`,

    `okay let's break down what's going on here with the latest on the coronavirus this morning. china now reported  deaths. and  new cases. that happened overnight. south korea raising its coronavirus alert now to the highest level after the number of cases. they're ballooned from  to more than . and that took place in less thanweek. now stocks in asia are plunging overnight. honk kong hang seng falling .% south korea the exchange there three down .%. now shares of south korea's two largest airlines tumbled as they canceled flights to the city to go where many of these new cases were detected. meantime italy's government is scrambling itself to deal with the biggest outbreak of the coronavirus outside of asia. and you're looking at stocks there tumbling as well. now off about four over f nearly % this morning. the government there placing at least ten towns in northern italy under quarantine. canceling the last few days of the venice carnival. elsewhere in italy schools museums universities and cinemas were all closed. and major soccer matches were canceled as well. and all of this contributing to the red arrows that you're seeing on your screen. but as joe mentioned earlier becky's gonna be talking to the one and only  right now who may have some unique views about all of this. so we wanna get to both of them in omaha. good morning to you becky.`,

    `hey good morning andrew good mooring joe. it's good to see both of you. we are here in omaha nebraska this morning with  the chairman and ceo of berkshire hathaway. he has just released his th annual shareholder letter to the shareholders over this weekend. and this is actually the th year that we are now in omaha talking to him after that letter. this isshow that we call ask warren so the people can write in their own questions to mr. buffett after they've read that shareholder's letter. but obviously this morning given the news there arelot of other questions that people have concerning the stock market. let's jump right into it with mr. buffett who is here with us right now. and warren thank you for being here today.`,

    `oh thanks for having me.`,

    `it's good to see you.wanna talk about the letter obviously one of the things that you touch on the level on the letter is when people should be buying stocks. we're gonna dig intolot of it. but when you're looking at the futures down about  points this morningthink probably the first thing viewers wanna hear from you are your thoughts on what's happening with the coronavirus if this isreason to panic and if you were worried about this.`,

    `well i don't know ifhave any special thoughts beyond the news on the coronavirus. the very first daybought stocks was march th  '. and the stocks were down about % that day as it turned out. unfortunatelybought in the morning. so whencame home in the evening and my dad told me the execution price it was down %. if you're buyingbusiness and that's what stocks are businesses in fact people would be better off if they say i boughtbusiness today notstock today because that gives youdifferent perspective on it than presumably good and buyfarm if you buy an apartmenthouse if you buybusiness you're gonna own it for ten or  or  years. and the real question is is has the tenyear or year outlook for american businesses changed in the last  hours or  hours and we're gonna you'll notice many of the businesses we own partially own american express we've owned it for  years cocacola we've owned it for  years but those are businesses. and—you don't buy or sell your business based on on today's headlines. and if it gives youchance to buy something that you like and you can buy it even cheaper then it's you're in good luck basically.`,

    `although there arelotta people who look at the market and say lookwanna buy butdon't wanna buy when the market's sitting at new highs when it's been hitting new records every day. maybe it's off  points this morning but maybe there's more ofdecline to come because the effect of the coronavirus is going to be an impact on the global economy. imf said that over the weekend. you are going to see weakness as not only china but other countries try and address this. you're right it may not change things over the five or tenyear span of things. but ifthinkcan buy something for potentially % cheaper maybe more than that ifwaitweek ormonth maybe that's what i'm sitting around`,

    `well if you think that then you gotta you're gonna get fabulously rich if you're right. all you have to do is just keeping buying in tenday intervals and keep making your tenday prediction. ifknew what the market was gonna do obviously. but you don'tdon't think anybody knows what the market's gonna do.think you know do know whether you're making an intelligent purchase atgiven price. everybody when they buystock if you're gonna buy say general motors that hasbillion  million shares out you should be able to takeyellow pad like there and on one page say let's say it's selling for . it isn't selling that low but that'd be $ billion. you should say i am buying the general motors company for $ billion because and you should get it onpiece of paper. and then if you wanna haveseparate piece of paper that says i thinkknow what the stock market's gonna do soknow whether it'll be higher or lower inweek but you don't. you don't have that`,

    `you don't but ifworry that the economy is gonna slow down not just for the quarter but for the year that would impact how many carsthink they might be able to sell or even produce.`,

    `guarantee you cars are gonna slow down some day. they and in  general motors had  dealers. that's more than all the auto dealers in the united states today. there are only  million people. but they had  dealers. they produced or sold and there was one monththink when they sold less  ofcar or right at ofcar per dealer. that wasterrific time to buy general motors. and forget about the market if you can putgood market you know you don't even have to read balance sheets. you don't you don't even need you don't even read any you certainly can't predict the market by reading the daily newspaper. that is for sure. and you really can't you certainly can't predict the market by listening to me. but you're buying businesses. and if you plan to buylocal service station yesterday and it was closing todaydon't think you'd tear your hair out or anything like that. you'd have already looked at it where it was located the contract that they had with the suppliers and madedecision on competition. people because they can make decisions every second in stocks whereas they can't with farms they think an investment in stocks is different than an investment inbusiness or an investment infarm or investment in an apartment house. but it isn't. if you get your money's worth in terms of future earning power over the next ten or  or  years you're gonna have madegood investment. and you can't pick them from day to day. if you can do that you can wellhaven't met anybody yet that that knows how to do it.`,

    `you madepoint of that inletter this year where you highlightedbook that was written by edgar lawrence smith back in . and you said until he came along nobody really realized the compound interest effect of buying stocks. not just buying businesses but buying stocks themselves.`,

    `that led keynes to actually say that this was an important book. people paid attention to it. but you're right it added to the frenzy that built up to .`,

    `well that is true because you can get an old boss ben graham told me very early on you can get in more trouble withgood idea thanbad idea because the good idea works.mean it'sgood idea to buyhome for example. and then people go crazy sometimes.good idea works and it works and it works. stocks work out better than bonds most of the time. and afterwhile people forget that there were some other limiting conditions. with edgar lawrence smith's book it was that when bonds yield the same as stocks which was the case then that stocks are gonna outperform because they have this retained earnings. so stocks started going up in the 's. and all ofsudden they were selling at five or six times the prices as when he bought the book. and the original correct perception on his part had experienced changing conditions. but people just looked they they got their confirmations for the stock price. and that's what happens in bull markets. people start out thinking stocks are cheap and then they start thinking stocks have gone up. andstock can begood buy orbad buy.bond can begood buy orbad buy. it depends on price.`,

    `and but that leads us to today.mean if his premise was that stocks are always going to bebetterbetter investment than bonds that's kinda what you hear today which we've been hearing forwhile is tina there is no alternative. right you have to buy stocks because bond yields are so low because interest rates are so low.`,

    `well if you look at the present situation we've talked about this before that you get more for your money in stocks than bonds. that doesn't have to be the case.mean but it's usually been in the case in america. very usually been the case. and if you buyyear bond today with yield % you're paying  times earnings for an investment where the earnings can't go up for  years. now if somebody said to you i wanna sell youstock that's at  times earnings. the earnings can't go up for  years you'd say that doesn't sound very good. stocks are way better than year bonds.mean it'sthat's clear. andthat's one of the alternatives people h people really have three basic alternatives shortterm cash which is an option of doing something later longtime bonds or longterm stocks. and stocks are cheaper than bonds.`,

    `charlie said recently charlie munger vice chairman at berkshire hathaway had his daily journal meeting justcouple weeks ago. and at that meeting he said that there'slot of wretched excess out there and that there'slot of trouble coming asresult. do you agree with that`,

    `there's always trouble coming. yeah there was trouble coming in  whenbought that first stock. all kinds of trouble. phillipines were gonna fall pretty soon. there's all kinds of trouble in . there was trouble certainly trouble in  whenwrote an article for the new york times.said trouble is coming. butsaid buy stocks.`,

    `would you repeat that this time if trouble's coming would you still say buy stocks right now`,

    `would say buy stocks if you get enough for your money. you know we buyfew stocks. but we don't look at we're not buying the stock market. we're sayingam buying say american express. we own american express. there's  million shares out. and sells at this morning it was $ or something like that. so it's selling for roughly $ billion. now the real question is whether the company's worth or more less than $ billion. it isn't what the stock is gonna do tomorrow or next week or next month.`,

    `you said justfew minutes ago when we asked you on worldwide exchange right now berkshire hathaway isnet buyer of stocks. you are innet buying position`,

    `we've beennet buyer of stocks or i've b actually beenpersonal net buyer of stocks ever sincewas  every year. and there's been  american presidents in my lifetime more than . i've lived under  of thedidn't buy stocks under hoover.was only about six months old then. but there've been seven republicans after that and seven democrats.bought stocks under every one of 'em. nowhaven't bought stocks every day. there've beenfew times i've bought stocks where were really quite high. and i've even written an article once or twice. but that's very seldom.`,

    `but you wrapped up your partnership at one point too.`,

    `wrapped up my partnership once because of that.`,

    `because you thought it was too expensive.`,

    `yeah.`,

    `okay. but this is nottime like that`,

    `we own $ billion worth of stocks now. we look at that as $ billion worth of businesses that we own parts of. butlove owning those businesses.`,

    `you've also got more than $ billion in cash sitting around.`,

    `yeah well that's we'd like to buy more businesses.`,

    `all right we're gonna talk more about that in justlittle bit. when we come back we have much more from . right now though i'll send it back to joe and andrew. guys back over.`,

    `joe kernen all right thanks becky. much more to come from the oracle.`,

    `good morning everybody. and welcome back to squawk box here on cnbc. i'm  i'm live in omaha with  the chairman and ceo of berkshire hathaway. he's just released his th annual letter to shareholders over this weekend. we've been taking questions from you. we'll be getting some of those questions in through this morning. we are here warren with you at berkshire hathaway's headquarters building. this is upstairs in the room that's called the cloud room. and this isroom where you often take students kinda talk to them about questions they have when they come to visit you. you also do some other things up here too other presentations.`,

    `yeah i have students here for dozens of years. and for many years  schools would come in. they'd come in groups of eight at five days i'd spendyear. and they come from all over the world. we have them from peru we have them from china we have from israel. and we havegood time obviously. ag i've given it up now. i but i started teaching whenwas . and i whengot to about thought i'll takerest.`,

    `well there arelotta questions that are coming in from viewers that have been hitting here today. they're waking up this morning looking at the stock market indicated down by almost  points for the dow. we're actually off our worst levels of the morning which is something to say when you're still looking at the dow down by about  points. but people havelotta questions about the economy. they're wondering what's happening right now particularly with the coronavirus out there. you havelotta economic data at your fingertips because not only are the many businesses that berkshire owns but the businesses you own pieces in. what are you seeing right now around the globe`,

    `well it affects various businesses.would say thatreceived commentaryget some commentary monthly with from from almost all of the companies. andgood many of them had some comment about how it was affecting them and how it was affecting them at that time i'm sure it's sure it's accentuated. but they've been affected by they were affected by tariffs they're affected by taxes they're affected by the most thing is they're affected by competitors and supply and demand over time. anddon't have the faintest idea what our businesses will be doing six months from now or  months from now.do think that not only our businesses but american business generally will be doing fabulously better  years from now or  years from now. and the longterm is very in my view is very easy to predict in the general way. but an important way.don't think there's any way to predict what the stock market will do ten minutes from now ten days from now or ten months from now. sowork on whatthink i i'm able to do. and as desirable as it might be to know what was gonna happen ten minutes from now that's just not something i'll ever be able to master. so fortunatelycan come topretty firm conclusion that  or  years from now american business and probably all over the world will be far better than it is now.`,

    `what are the momentary implications that you've seen from coronavirus what's an example of the business`,

    `well an example is that we have maybe  dairy queen franchises in china here. and they're just treat only so they're the old type of food. butgreat number of them were closed. but the ones that were open weren't doing any business to speak of. and apple ismeanmuch bigger holding is apple. we own .% of apple. and the company came out and said that it's affecting not only its stores but all kinds of things supply chain andfind that certain of our companies have got supply chain arrangements that are being affected thatdidn't even knowhad those.`,

    `like what`,

    `wellgot one from john mandal the other day for example you wouldn't normally think of them as havingbig supply chain but shaw carpets or you name it. i'll guarantee you thatvery significant percentage of our businesses one way are affected by this. but they're being affected bylot of other things too. and the real question is where are those businesses gonna be in five or ten years. they'll have ups and downs. our candy business iswonderful business. but it loses money seven months out of the year. but the nice thing is christmas comes every year.`,

    `when you look at the economy and how things were kind of chugging along let's say beginning of this year when first things first picked up how would you gauge the u.s. economy at that point`,

    `well it it's strong butlittle softer than it was six months ago. but that's overbroad range of you look at car holdings railcar holdings that that's moving goods around. and there again that was affected bythe tariffs too because people frontended purchases all kinds of things alllotta variables. but business is down. and but it's down fromvery good level. sowould say that looking at our  businesses and that actually they represent hundreds in addition they'relittle softer. and on the other handwas out with the fellows from the nebraska furniture mart just saturday night andtheir business was up quitebit in february. but that's because weather was good. so you havelot of variables that hit.`,

    `whydo you think business was down let's say the last six months is itdecline in confidence or is it coming off of levels where there was unusual activity ahead of that`,

    `well it isn't really down. it's just it leveled off andlittle softer maybe now. but look tariffs the tariff situation wasbig question market for all kinds of companies. andstill is to some degree. but that that was front and center forwhile. now coronavirus is front and center. something else will be front and center six months from now andyear from now and two years from now. real question is where your where are these businesses gonna be five and ten and  years from now some of them will do sensationally some of them will disappear. and overallthink america will do very well you know it has since .`,

    `but you still watch things like railcar load`,

    `oh yeah.`,

    `very closely.`,

    `watch everything. butdon't do it to make in specific investment decisions. i it but i enjoymean i wanna know what's going on. butalso don't think thatcan make money by predicting what's gonna go on next week or next month.do thinkcan make money by predicting what's gonna happen in ten years.`,

    `all right tell us more about what's going on just since you like knowing about those things.`,

    `well i assay you know the certain businesses depend on weather to quite an extent. in retail for example in given months but the big trends you see are going onmean in terms of movement to online commerce. andmean the big stuff keeps moving. but we've gotbig investment in airline business andjust heard they're even more flights are canceled and all that. but flights are canceled for weather. it so happens in this case they're gonna be canceled for longer because of coronavirus. but if you own airlines for ten or  years you're gonna have some ups and down in current business. and some of them will be weather related and s they can be all kinds of things. the real question is you know how many passengers are they gonna be carrying ten years from now and  years from now and what will margins be and what will the competitive position be and butstill look at the figures all the time.  i'll admit that.`,

    `you you mentioned the airlines. and you own stakes in all the major airlines but`,

    `all.`,

    `not as much as delta.think you own north of % of delta at this point`,

    `well`,

    `or right`,

    `we the our largest position is in delta three of the four positions are mine. one of the positions is one of the other fellows the four positions. but we ownvery roughly ten close to % of the four largest airlines.`,

    `there's beenlotta speculation. in fact some of the questions that came in over this weekend were questions about those airlines. wondering if you would buy any of them outright. have you considered buying any of those companies outright`,

    `it'd be very unlikely that we would do that. i'm not saying it's impossible. but it's complicated.`,

    `why`,

    `well for one thing they're regulated and there's an interplay. i'll just give you an example not that we would be doing. but with delta we own % of american express and american express isbank holding company and bank holding companies have limits as to what they can do. and we'repassive holder ofbank holding company with american express. but instead we own an airline that was tied up with them they'd have lots of arrangements. there'slot of complications because it'sa regulated industry. anytime you get inregulated industry you have more complications and in transactions.`,

    `so is it fair to say you like these stocks and you would own more if it wasn't complicated`,

    `well weto go beyond % in any company we'd have to go in oni mean there'slotta rules as you increase your ownership. obviously almost anything we own we like to own more of.`,

    `are you buying more of any of those stakes right now apple shares –`,

    `get pretty closed mouth when it comes to what we're buying.`,

    `you thought about that forsecond.`,

    `all ofsuddenfeel my jaws lock up.`,

    `but fair to say`,

    `but it's fair to say that anything that we own we like. you know and there's very few stocks that we own andlook at them as part ownerships in businesses. there's very few that are selling at some price wherewould sell themlittle higher.`,

    `all right well let me askquestion that came from tony dickinson. he said in the fourth quarter berkshire sold  million shares of wells fargo. should shareholders view this aslack of confidence in the new ceo turnaround plan and what is warren's future outlook for wells fargo`,

    `wellwon't give him any advice specifically on wells fargo. but it's absolutely true that we've sold down our position. some of it was sold down to avoid being over % because then you do have some filings with the fed and so on but—`,

    `they've sold well more than that.`,

    `yeah we've soldmore than that.`,

    `think it's .% was the last—`,

    `yeah. that sounds right. and now we sold wells fargo in the fourth quarter and we sold earlier.`,

    `canask why only becausedid getnumber of questions about`,

    `yeah wellcan understand that. but we don't want to give any advice on what we're doing becausecould change what i'm doing tomorrow. we talk about everything except we don't give stock advice.`,

    `ok. i'll try one more from tony dickinson just becausethinkgot  or  different questions on this. berkshire owns . billion of bank of america and . billion of wells fargo one position's been increasing while the other's been decreasing. does warren like bank of america twice as much as wells fargo and how should shareholders see the holding`,

    `yeah wellthink they've sees that we've bought bank of america and we've sold some wells fargo.`,

    `all right let me ask youbroader question that comes in just on interest rates and the impact that they might have as well. varun jain writes in on facebook hi i'mhuge fan and student of mr. buffett. please ask him what impact does the zerointerest rate environment across places like japan and europe have on their banks whether the business is still good. and does the prolonged lowinterest rate regime in the united state hurt the prospects of american banks like jpmorgan etc. and in such circumstances do indian banks which have high return on equity look attractive to mr. buffett`,

    `yeah wellcan't comment on that but–`,

    `know that but—`,

    `generally speaking but there arelot of other variables toobut the banks are going to make more money if there are higher rates withsteeper curve. the curve makesis more important than there was the ten year versus shortterm rates. they make more difference than the absolute level. but american banks have made very good money with very low interest rates. around the world if you look in the u.k. or europe or japan even lower rates have made it pretty tough for banks. the returns on equity are not as high. and they have to use more leverage to even get the same returns anddon't like that as well.`,

    `if you were talking about the curve that we're looking at this morning the fiveyear twoyear is inverted. twoyear ten is not right now. but the tenyear's below .% this morning.`,

    `and think of it the tenyear at .% that means you're paying  times earnings for something that can't increase its earnings for ten years.`,

    `that'sgood way of looking at it.`,

    `if somebody came to you withstock and said you know this isterrific stock. it sells at  times earnings. the earnings can't go up for ten years you'd say well explain that to me again. but nowe've never seensituation like this in the world. literally.mean you can go back and read keynes and you can read adam smith and you can read you know all the great ones. and they don't talk about negative interest rate. it never crossed their mind. always supply and demand and all these marginal costs. but brilliant economists never really anticipated that you would have negativeyou've got  trillion or something like thatworldwide at negative interest rates. and we don't know what that means. and we've gotlot of people that can speculate what it means. but ten years from now or fifteen years from now we'll look back and say well it was obvious what would happen with that and we'll see it. but it is notnormal situation. and well interest rates are the basis of all value.mean you know if you knew interest rates we're going to be zero for  years you would think % wasgreat rate of return. but you also would know if you bought something was yielding % or that was what it paid and rates went to % you'd lose practically all your capital. so it's an enormous factor. and we don't know the answer central banks don't know the answer. all we know is that it's been useful in stimulating things and particularly asset prices now for ten years and what we thought was temporary in  and ' in the way monetary policy to stimulate we've just put our foot on the gas even further. the whole world has.`,

    `you madepoint in the letter of saying that you don't know how long these interest rates will last. you and charlie never try and figure these things out. but we did have st. louis fed president jim bullard on the program last week. and he said that he expects to see these low interest rates forlong time to come. that does raiselot of questions. if that happens about what this means for the stock market what that means for banks what that means for insurance companies which you touched on in the letter too.`,

    `it's bad for insurance companies. but it's good for stocks.`,

    `bad for insurance companies and what happens to the insurance companies asresult are they getting moreare some insurance companies going to push out risk`,

    `well the ones that really get hurt on it are either life or annuity companies that have promised returns. property casualty business doesn't promise returns. it still holds money so it hurts them. but if you promise somebody an annuity that's clearly to pay them % or % and now you find that you're reinvesting your money at % or something you know you're going to disappear.`,

    `are insurance companies being forced to make riskier and riskier bets`,

    `well they shouldn't.mean the answerif you need to get % and you're only getting % the answer is to quit giving %. it's not to try and get the one up to three and do more dangerous things. you should always adapt your consumption to your income. you shouldn't try and adjust your income to your consumption. that'sbasic principle for individuals businesses and everything else. and reaching for yield is really stupid. but it's very human.mean andunderstand it. people say well i've saved all this money all my life and nowcan only get %. what dodo the answer is you learn to live on % unfortunately. and you don't go and listen to some salesman come along and tell you i've got some magic way to get you %.`,

    `do you think though that's what should be happening. do you think that there is more risktaking place in the insurance market asresult`,

    `sure. and you see that inthey call leverage loans and weaker covenants. no people are reaching for yield. there's no question about that. and that's stupid. and it has consequences over time. but it's very human.`,

    `consequences that could havebig market impact`,

    `depends how far it goes. yeah. yeah. it's something thatthings that get built in slowly people going crazy and tech companies in the late s. it could takelot longer than you think. but eventually you get to midnight and everything turns to pumpkins and mice.`,

    `you know that's the downside of low interest rates pensions savers anybody who gets left inraw position of that. on the alternate side of things if rates were to rise rapidly or maybe not even so rapidly what does that mean for the federal debt`,

    `well it depends on the average maturity of the debt. but our maturities are fairly short. they've got lengthenedlittle. but if you take  trillion and you're borrowing at % you've got what have you got two trillion billion.mean you got  billion of the expense. but close to % you got  billion of the expense.mean no at % you gottrillion of expense. i'm sorry. we are benefiting enormously in our national budget by the fact that inverse rates are very low. and so interest cost has not gone up as you would've anticipated if you were looking at the scene  or  years ago with the increase in national debt. you know wall street issued year bonds. you know but % or thereabouts. and then they've gone way way up and thatmaybe they yield . or something like that.don't know where they are now. but it's great if you'reborrower gee maybe everybody should refinance their mortgage.`,

    `is that an argument for the federal reserve or i'm sorry for the treasury department here issuing longer notes`,

    `well yeah butwould've said the same thing five or six years ago and been wrong. but if weunder the present slope it still would cost more to lengthen it out. but you're lengthening it out at very very low rates. and it would be whatwould be inclined to do ifwere secretary treasury. butwould have missedlot of bets in the last ten years too.`,

    `all right we're going to have much more with  when we come back. we'll talklittle bit about conglomerates and whether berkshire hathaway is being discounted in the market because it'sconglomerate. but guys right now i'll send it back over to you.`,

    `hey joe thanks very much. warren again for people who are just waking up they're tuning in and they want to know what you think about this selloff this morning. to see the dow down   points in the morning what's your reaction when you see something like that`,

    `alright. not to mix metaphors but can you havedecentralized central office running both the french restaurant and the hamburger place`,

    `well they aren't trying we're not trying to have railroad management run the utility here.`,

    `no decentralized. that's whatmean.decentralized headquarters that's in chargeconglomerate in charge of all those different businesses.`,

    `well you we could run we have decentralized management as it is. we could have somebody in charge of all the little companies another one the big. we could visualize it in all kinds of ways.think we'd have more overhead.think we'd have eight different sort of manager. our managers like running their own businesses. and they like  they never have to finance their businesses.mean we and they never have to go to wall street. they never they probably save % of their time. andwant them to feel they own their businesses. and that's all they're responsible for. if we mess up some other way you know they still they get paid based on how they do. and there again we attract managers who like to operate on that basis. we don't attract managers particularly who think they're going to keep moving step by step through various divisions and eventually run the whole place.`,

    `all right. we can talk more about succession later because you did write an awful lot about that in the annual letter too. but right now we're going to send things back over to andrew.`,

    `thanks becky. we're going to havelot more from omaha and  right after the break. do takelook though at futures. as we speak we're back to about being off about  points on the dow. the nasdaq looking to open down about  points. the s&p  looking to open down about  points. all on additional new fears about the spread of the coronavirus. we'll talk about that and so much more. the oracle of omaha right after the break when we return.`,

    `welcome back to squawk box. this is cnbc. we're here withspecial show with  in omaha nebraska. but before we continue with that let's getquick check on the financials this morning. if you've been watching the futures you're going to see that overall the dow futures are indicated down by over  points. we've seen levels of worse than  points off this morning. but you seebig part of that comes from the banks themselves. the banks if you look across the board are down by about %. if you're looking at goldman sachs bank of america citigroup down by .% jpmorgan chase off %. wells fargo downlittle less it's down by about .%. again we're with  the chairman and ceo of berkshire hathaway today. and warren one of the things that people wrote ina lot of people had questions about the banks about what's happening with the banks what you've changed with some of your investments of over time. jason goldberg writes in. he says`,

    `‘please ask warren about his views on the bank stocks in general and on wells fargo in particular. over the last few quarters he has sold almost onequarter of his longstanding wells fargo stake. also in the fourth quarter he dumpedthird of his goldman stockgoldman sachs shares although he still owns over $ billion in bank equity.' so what do you think about banks not necessarily the selloff today because you don't look at day by day.`,

    `well banking isgood business if you don't do dumb things on the asset side.mean basically. and it'sbusiness that the banks we own earn between the commercial banks earn between % and % or so on net tangible assets. that'sgood business. it'sfantastic business against the longterm bond you know at %. if you havechoice between% instrument and% instrument which one's going to win over time so if you asked me whetherthink banks are going to go down when they only earn % or % on tangible assetsdon't think that will happen. the question is really whether they do something massively dumb.mean which periodicallynumber of banks have done. andfeel very good about the banks we own. they're very attractive compared to most other securitiessee. and most of them are buying bank of america's buyinglot of stock every year. so our ownership of the bank of america this year probably will go up % or % without us spendingdime. i'd like to own any business any good business where my ownership goes up % or % every year without me spending any money and on top of itgetdividend. so they're very attractive both against interest rates and against or against bonds and against other stocks in my view.`,

    `you say occasionally they do dumb things. maybe you're talking about wells fargo with the scandal that it had it just settled on friday withnumber of the regulatory institutions that were kind of looking into it the investing allegations that were taking place for $ billion.`,

    `does this mean that they have kind of finally gotten through that and can move forward`,

    `don't know the answer to that.know that they're paying $ billion because it was announced.don't know what else is outstanding. but wells fargo's classic in terms of one lesson. my partner charlie munger he's you know he says ‘whenever we haveproblem you attack it immediately.' he says ‘an ounce of prevention is not worthpound of cure. an ounce of prevention is worthton of cure.' and we've seen that time after time. and the interesting thing i anddon't know the details at all but the original thing wasbunch of whole bunch of phony accounts. nowdon't know how if you open upcouple million phony accounts you make any money on it at all.don't the shareholders didn't make money. people say well the—`,

    `well the incentive structure was set up so that some of the employees did`,

    `it was the dumbest incentive—`,

    `make most of the money.`,

    `system you can think. and as soon as you learn you can devise dumb incentive systems. we've done them ourselves.mean you can you can cause people to do the wrong thing. because they will do what they're incented to do. and they had a—obviouslyvery dumb incentive system. people started playing it various ways. and the big thing is they ignored it when they found out about it.mean you're going to do dumb things in business. and we do them every day you know but you absolutely have to attackproblem as soon as it occurs and you know about it. and if that had happened wells fargo shareholders would belot better off. but wells fargo shareholders did not profit from opening up accounts that were phony accounts that had nothing in them.mean somebody was getting paid so much per account. so and the practice spread because bad practices do spread if they're allowed to spread. and they were ignored which istotal disaster. and look at the consequences. so two or three years later who's paying the shareholders are paying for something that didn't do any good whatsoever.`,

    `is that why you've sold off some of the shares`,

    `no. not specifically.`,

    `know you don't want to get specific on why you`,

    `no i'm not i'm not i'm not recommending itit's what stockspeople have to make up their owns minds on that. but—`,

    `okay.want to ask youquestion about todd combs and his new role at geico. i've got several questions that came in from that. and let's just use this one from peter lamperis ‘during last year's interview on cnbc after the  letter was released you were asked about succession at geico and you mentioned that atrecent meeting at geico you met about  of their top executives. and after each introduced themselves they stated their length of time with the company. the shortest was  years. please explain why none of these  top executives were qualified to take over as ceo after the retirement of bill roberts.' again that's pete lamperis from chicago.`,

    `bill roberts took over not even two years ago. and last and he has doneterrific job in connection with tony nicely.mean geico is my first love. absolutely.tell the other companies that you can't you can compete for my second love but you can't compete for my first love which is geico. because it goes back  years. and it did wonders for me. anyway geico bill roberts took overlittle less than two years ago. and then in either october of november last year he said he would he'd like to retire inyear. he would adjust it in any way that made it easiest for us. and we did not have the person in my view to replace him at that point. and todd combs who's worked with berkshire now for  years he actually wasproduct manager at progressive in the past and he knowslot about insurance. insurance is probably the only businessknow something about that we're in. all the rest of them are total confusion. butunderstand the insurance business to some degree. todd understands it very well at the operating level. and so todd is there andhope very much that he's not there very long because i'd like to get him back in omaha. but our intention always is to promote from within. and we would hope to have pick out the right person at geico. it isn't that there isn't somebody there. it's just you want to have the right one. because when you put somebody in you're going to keep him there forlong time. and or her. and—`,

    `does that suggest todd is not going to be there forlong time`,

    `don't think he'sno no. the plan is not for him to be.mean he has not madepermanent career shift. and he you knowdon't know how long he'll be there. we have one important problem which is which all insurance companies have. but progressive has donebetter job of managing—of correlating our risk with rate. and that is what we're focused on now.`,

    `correlating risk—`,

    `but we're—`,

    `with rate meaning—`,

    `in other words having the proper rate.`,

    `right. charging the right amount for—`,

    `charging the right amount. if you were in the life insurance business and you thought that yearolds had the same life expectancy as yearolds  you'd havebig big problem. and what would happen is you'd write all the yearolds and somebody would write all the yearolds. so in auto insurance the same thing. there'svast difference—`,

    `in auto insurance i'm not sure.might prefer the yearolds over the yearold.`,

    `well you might. and you you certainly would prefer the yearolds to yearolds.mean—`,

    `right.`,

    `yeah. yeah. so and you'd prefer the yearold female toyearold male. there'swhole bunch of things. so you've got to cor you really got to segment risk. and that's enormously important. and every company's trying to do it better all the time. we do it far better than we did  years ago but we have room for improvement on that. we're focused on that. and in the meantime we're growing faster. we're gaining market share. geico isfantastic asset. todd's job is to focus on that but it's also to work himself out ofjob very quickly. and preferably to work definitely preferably to work himself out ofjob with somebody from geico.`,

    `eric lefante writesfollowup question. he says ‘warren why did you and ajit decide to appoint todd combs as the ceo of geico' that part you've answered.`,

    `yeah.`,

    `but ‘how will he be able to run geico manage$ billion investment portfolio oversee haven and be on the board of jpmorgan'`,

    `yeah well let's it'll keep him busy. and we're and we've told him he has unlimited use ofnetjet. so`,

    `really`,

    `oh sure. nomean we want him to be efficient. that's what netjets is for. and he you know he'll be working hour weeks. the question about the portfolio is interesting. most months neither ted nor todd makessingle change in their portfolio.mean portfolio management is something that you learn over decades. and whenran salomon i you knowwas running berkshire portfolio. it is not something that you have to sit there day by day and do. people do it that way. but if there are many years where ifjust left the portfolio entirely the same and didn't make any changes we'd be better off. so that's notproblem. but you're right in terms of jpmorgan's board haven all that. he's he's going to bevery busy guy. geico'stop priority but it isn't going to stay the top priority forlong long time.`,

    `alright let me run to another question that max wrote in ‘have todd combs and ted weschler outperformed the s&p  since they began working at berkshire why don't you disclose their record'`,

    `why don't i`,

    `‘why don't you disclose their record' they said.`,

    `well we're not disclosingthink it would be very unusual forfirm to disclose everybody's sales last year among their salespeople or anything like that.think that's they're entitled to work in relative anonymity. our directors know how they do.know how they do. we've madelot of money with them.feel very goodi meanfeel very good about them in all ways. but we're not going to we're not going to tell you how much each candy store sells at see's candy or who was the top the top person at any place brought in in sales or whatever it may be.`,

    `all right. let's jump to berkshire's overall record versus the s&p. berkshire has now underperformed the s&p  on oneyear threeyear fiveyear and year marks.`,

    `yep.`,

    `is that because it's too big and will it ever be able to outperform the—`,

    `well certainly being too big is part of it. and butwould say this. during that same timemean last year we achieved nowdon't like gaap earnings very well but we achieved the highest gaap earnings of any company in the world has ever achieved that's investor owned. and we have the highest net worth of any company in the world investor owned. any company in the world. so itwould say related to safety of principal over timefeel good about it. andfeel good about the fact that % of my money's in it and that it will be the source of all the philanthropic contributions that are made for  ordozen years afterdie. so butdon't thinkdo not think it will be in the top % of stocks performing over the next  years.don't think it'll be in the top % of stocks performing in the next  or  years.also don't think it'll be in the bottom % or % or %. so but our ability to havehuge edge over the market generally with$ billion market value it's just it'll be minor but it'll be done invery very safe manner.`,

    `is an investment in the s&p better investment than—`,

    `it could be.`,

    `at berkshire`,

    `it could be. you know on balancethink we'll dolittle better. but it'll be it'll be minor. depends on the kind of market we're in. if we're indown market we're we're going to beat it.mean it's that simple. and sometimes we will beat. the last  years. we haven't been. but over  years it's worked. and and it it will continue working. but it it will not work at all like it did when we were working with $ million orbillion dollars. there's no question about that. but we've got good businesses and we're we won't be in the bottom quartilepromise you that over any long period of time.`,

    `there are people like there were back in  who have said maybe you've lost your edge. it wassimilar thing in  where you saw the technology stocks that were the big high flyers that people were pouring their money into the .com companies andlot of others associated with that. if you look at the markets again it's the technology companies that have big runs. this time you're participating in in apple which is one of those frontrunners. but is thiscyclical thing to you do you think there'll be another market downturn and then—`,

    `oh there'll bedownturn—`,

    `berkshire outperforms`,

    `sometime. there'll bebig—`,

    `and and and berk berkshire outperforms at that point or`,

    `oh we'll outperform indown market. but but that may not be particularly satisfactory to people. but no we will because we have these businesses that are making money and thatmean we are we are not we're geared somewhat away from full market participation in either direction. but that's fine. we own if you think about it we're somepercent in equities. we may show $ or $ billion in equities and that looks like we're against our market cap we're %. but we own % of these other businesses. those are equities too.mean we ownrailroad. and we we own insurance companies. and those are those are equities. so we're about % in roughly in equities and about % in cash. and i'd rather i'd rather have that % in other good businesses. but that is to some extentcurse of size. and it's to some extent the fact that it's very hard. if interest rates stay at this level we'll wish we'd for the next  or  years we'll wish we'd been % in equities.mean it you know equities are so much cheaper than bonds long bonds that you know some something will change inmajor way.just don't know what. andwant to be prepared for anything obviously.`,

    `so that's why you keep so much cash around. you want to be able to be prepared fordownturn. you want to be prepared for—`,

    `we—`,

    `a crisis.`,

    `we want to be prepared for anything becky. we want to be prepared for pandemics. we want to be prepared for anything comes along. yeah. that is the chief jobhave.have people's money that gave it to me  or  years ago and some of them still have % of their money essentially in it. and the one thing and i've got the responsibility for five foundations that presently are going to get $ billion andthink will getlot more over time probably. we don't want to permanently lose money. and you don't want to get that so that you go intoshell and don't do anything. but we have obligations to people on workers compensation claims and auto accidents they've had that go out  years. and you know we have to run the place so that every check clears under any circumstances. and that's why we incident we own treasury bills. we don't we don't own commercial paper. we don't rely on bank lines or anything. when people get terrified and they will occasionally everything freezes you know and and you're going to have to stand on your own feet attime like that. it won't happen very often but it'll happen occasionally.`,

    `know you've developedthick skin over the years but does it tick you off when people start questioning whether you've lost it whether you can still—`,

    `well i i'm sure i've lost some of it.meancan tell you all kinds of things i've lost. no that happens. but we haven't lost geico or the railroads we own or the berkshire without me is worth essentially the same as berkshire with me.mean i my my value added is is not high. but butdon't think i'm subtracting value by the way. but the big thing is how our businesses do and what we get to add in the way of businesses over time. and we can add them through marketable securities.mean we own . orlittle over percent of apple. it's probably the best businessknow in the world. and we own .% of it. and that isbigger commitment than we have in anything except insurance and the railroad. so it's it's our thirdlargest business.`,

    `yeah. made the point that it was bigger than your biggest acquisition precision castparts`,

    `oh for sure. it's our thirdlargest business.`,

    `all right. let me test you on your thick skin.`,

    `okay. wow.`,

    `here was the kicker of that barron's cover story. he said ‘there's reason to think that the company will bemarket beater when he's gone. in the meantime happy th.'`,

    `yeah well it's ihope it ismarket beater when i'm gone. i'm counting on it. i'm telling my estate and then the trustees that succeed my executors in the estate i'm telling them to keep every share of berkshire they have until they have this pattern of giving it away.meanwant them to look back and say gee we should have made this change earlier. because it's going to determine how much we buy in the way of vaccines and you know and and all kinds of things education and all these things. andfeel terrific about berkshire afterleave.`,

    `all right. we're going to continue this conversation with warren in justmoment. in the meantime andrew i'll send it back over to you.`,

    `thank you becky. we're going to get back to becky and  in justcouple minutes. but we do want to get you up to speed on this morning's news. financial software maker intuit is reportedly about to strike$ billion deal. wall street journal reporting that intuit the company behind turbotax and quickbooks will soon announcedeal to buy creditmonitoring service credit karma which it will operate asstandalone business. but it will give them all sorts of data about your credit score. some privacy concerns as well. separately pepsico has strucktakeover deal in china. it's buying chinese snack brand becherry for $ million. and there'snew challenger in the plantbased burger business. cargill one of the world's largest privatelyheld companies is launchingnew line of plantbased meat products. this would bechallenge to companies like beyond meat and impossible foods. now new offerings will go on sale in april. squawk box is live and we are back with  right after this.`,

    `joe kernen markets are selling off on fears of the coronavirus the spreading coronavirus and its impact on the global economy. here's the latest. china reported an additional  deaths and  new cases overnight. south korea raised its coronavirus alert to the highest level after the number of cases there ballooned from  to more than  in less thanweek. stocks in asia slipping overnight. hong kong's hang seng fell just .% but south korea's kospi fell nearly %. shares of south korea's two largest airlines were lower. they canceled flights to the city of daegu where many of the new cases were detected. and meantime shifting to another part of the world italy's government is scrambling to deal with the biggest outbreak of the coronavirus outside of asia. and stocks there dropped overnight. the government placed at least ten towns in northern italy under quarantine and canceled the last few days of the venice carnival. elsewhere in italy schools museums universities and cinemas were closed and major soccer matches were canceled.`,

    `we've gotlot more from  still to come on the broadcast. as we head tobreak here's another look at futures. dow in the red about  points right now. we opened up nasdaq down about  points. s&p  off about  points. here'slook at the biggest decliners in the s&p  in premarket trading. you're looking at advanced micro down % freeportmcmoran down close to % as well. asreminder you can always watch us live on the go on the cnbc app. we're right back after this with .`,

    `good morning everybody and welcome back tospecial edition of squawk box. we are live in omaha nebraska with  chairman and ceo of berkshire hathaway. he's just released his shareholders letter that he writes every year has been writing for the last  years now. and warren thank you very much for being with us today`,

    `well thanks for coming.`,

    `we've talked aboutlot of different issues. for people who are just waking up this morningwant to once again point out that the dow futures right now are indicated down by about  points. that's not the weakest level that we've seen this morning. we have seen off more than  points at different various times. we'll be watching this very closely. of course this is because of what's been happening with the coronavirus with the additional cases that have been picked up in additional countries and what that may mean for global growth. we'll talk more about that with mr. buffett in justmoment. we have been talking about that this morning. but warrenwant to talk about another issue that we have not touched on that. and that's politics here in the united states. we just watched the nevada caucus. bernie sanders walked away with the most delegates after that. he looks to be the clear frontrunner for the nomination for the democrats this time around. you have long beensupporter of the democratic party. what do you think`,

    `wellthink i'm going to wait and see who gets the nomination. but i'mdemocrat but i'm notcardcarrying democrat. and i've voted for republicans. i've contributed to republicans. in fact i've only run for two offices in my life. one was head of the young republicans at the university of pennsylvania and the other timewas actually on the ballot running for delegate to the republican national convention in . but normallyvote for democrats. and we will see what happens.`,

    `wow. that's the first time i've ever heard you say something like that.`,

    `well it's i've kept itsecret for all these years but now it comes out.`,

    `you just said that you're notcardcarrying democrat.`,

    `it's true.`,

    `you arecardcarrying capitalist. you actually have`,

    `absolutely.`,

    `one of those in your wallet.`,

    `yeah.`,

    `i've seen it.`,

    `don't know whether i'mcardcarrying capitalist right.don't think that's consistent with inconsistent with whatsaid on politics. yeah here it is. yeah.don't know whether that shows`,

    `for those who can't see i'll show you on this camera right here.`,

    `cardcarrying capitalist. and`,

    `this is what you carry in your wallet.`,

    `yeah. andthinkthink we will have some of those available at the annual meeting too for our shareholders.`,

    `think andrew's gotquestion that he wanted to jump in with here. andrew`,

    `andrew ross sorkinwas just going to follow up on that question warren which was aboutyear ago we had asked you about michael bloomberg. and you had said that if he ever entered the race he was somebody you would support. would you support him is he your candidate`,

    `wellwould certainly vote for him.don't thinkdon't think another billionaire supporting him would be the best thing to announce. but surewould iwould have no trouble voting for mike bloomberg.`,

    `and what do you think`,

    `andincidentally welldon't thinkwant to get into handicapping the race. but i would say this in terms of sanders.actually agree with him in terms of certain things he would like to accomplish.don't agree with him in many ways. but in terms of the fact that we ought to do better by the people that get left behind by our capitalist system.don't think we should kill the capitalist system in the process.think we should make sure that the golden goose keeps laying more eggs. and it's worked wonderfully since . but it doesn't work as well for people whose talents aren't really geared tomarket economy. anddon't think anybody should be left behind by an economy that has over $ of gdp per capita. and so i'mbig fan of increasing the earned income tax credit. and i'm you know ithink there should be some changes made. butif givenchoicewould certainly vote for mike bloomberg as opposed to sanders.`,

    `there isplan. let's talk about some of sanders' plans. you said you agree with some of what his intentions are but let's talk about some of those actual plans. one of those plans would be to give % of company stock to employees and put workers on the board. what do you think about that that would be for any company public company that has more than $ million in annual revenue or$ million balance share`,

    `welldon't want to get involved in evaluating his whole plan butthink that would beparticularly bad idea.`,

    `because`,

    `welljust i don't think thatdon't think putting % of the capitalists onlabor union is probablygood idea either. and i think the market system works very very well in terms of developing more goods and services.mean when you flew out here to omaha if you'd flown out here in you wouldn't have been able to fly in . you wouldn't have seen anything. everything you see is the product ofsystem that's worked like nothing's ever worked in the history of the world. so ido not believe in messing up our system of developing output.do believe that that anybody who's willing to work  hoursweek and hascouple kids should not have to havesecond job. andbelieve in havinghigher income for people. not necessarilyhigher minimum wage. but ido not think it's at all unreasonable that the income tax credit produces at least $ an hour maybe higher in certain areas. so i'm in very much in sympathy with the fact that senator sanders believes thatlot of people are getting left behind and through no fault of their own. and there's all kinds of aspects of capitalism that can need in some ways to be regulated butdon't believe in giving up the capitalist system.`,

    `all right. let me slip in some questions that viewers have written in on this front. michael blank writes in please ask warren if he thinks the market will sell off it if becomes clear that bernie sanders will win the democratic nomination.`,

    `thinknormally would never makecomment on something like that butwould say that if you had sanders anddemocratic house and senate or if you had trump withrepublican house and senate there would besignificant difference. butdon't thinkwould necessarily vote on what in factknowwouldn't vote on whatthought necessarily would affect the market the better. ithink it'svery poor yardstick. i would not want to cast my vote inpresidential election based on which would be better for the market in the next  or  or  days after the election.`,

    `overmuch broader period of time`,

    `certain aspects of the economy. and certain things he you know i'd like to see done.would like to see the earned income tax credit change dramatically upward.`,

    `alan buckey writes inletter. he says if michael bloomberg becomes the democratic candidate would you consider buying his company`,

    `no.can give youcategorical answer to that.`,

    `because of the price because of the`,

    `there'd be be something to pay more more.`,

    `okay.think that gets us right towards the end of the hour. so guys we will send it back to you in the studio.`,

    `not bad.`,

    `joe kernen anyway get back to business.just i'm looking forward to it warren. andknow we always have our own personal bet. ifget them all right you give me berkshire hathaway which would be cool for me.`,

    `i'll tell you if you get it all the way i'll give you my berkshire hathaway shares all the way to the .`,

    `wow. wow.`,

    `fill outbracket.`,

    `joe kernengiving pledge.`,

    `andrew ross sorkinguess that's the ultimate giving pledge.`,

    `that's how sure he is that you won't be able to do it.`,

    `joe kernen i'm pretty sure.`,

    `andrewhear you havequestion too andrew`,

    `all right. thank you for your time today. we really appreciate it your generosity with your time. and we hope to see you again soon.`,

    `come every year.`
